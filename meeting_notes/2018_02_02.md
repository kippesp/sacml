# Opening

Who is who?  Why are we here?  What do we want to do?

# Other "Meetup" Groups Further Away

- https://www.meetup.com/Projects/
- https://www.meetup.com/SF-Data-Science/

# Ideas: Kaggle Competition

- (introductory problem) https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
- (real-world problem) https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018

# Group's Goal

We will meet periodically to talk about the problem we've collectively chosen
to work on.  We will independently on the problem, communicate through a shared
channel, and see how things go.  We will make solutions available on github.

# For Next Time

Work on the Titanic Kaggle problem.  Possible solutions could make use of
Python, numpy, and scikit-learn.  No restrictions on what each person picks.
