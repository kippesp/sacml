# Minutes

## Summary

- No meeting next week; various conflicts with a large number of our group
- Most are in week 2 or 3 of Ng's Coursera DL specialization
- Watched and discussed the Geoffrey Hinton/Andrew Ng interview at the end of
  week 1.
- We will maintain either a "list of papers lists" or create a small subset
  of our own.  The intent of having our own is to point new people to a
  smaller subset of material that represents a solid set of leveling
  material.
