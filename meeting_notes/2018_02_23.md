## Summary

- We will put the Kaggle problems on the back burner for now.
- Individually we will focus on whatever ramp is required in order to obtain
  enough knowledge to work towards challenging Kaggle problems
- Our weekly meeting will be led by one or two people who will be target
  towards the beginning of the week to present a topic of interest.  This could
  be a contrast of a learning approach, library, blogs to reference, or research
  paper.  Alternatively, since we are each in a class or three, present on one of
  the problems of the course in sufficient detail that others can learn from it.
  What worked well?  What had to be changed or was a bad path?  Packages used and
  why?
- Individuals provided what MOOC courses actively working on so that those in
  the same MOOC can group together more easily.
