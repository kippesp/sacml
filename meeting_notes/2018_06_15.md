# Minutes

We've stopped work on the whale project due to time and priority demands.  New
focus: leveling our knowledge.

- Future (unscheduled)
    - Capsule Networks once we finish ImageNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet
    - Quote from area meetup:

            For many years Geoff Hinton has been saying that CNNs work well but have
            fundamental flaws.  He has developed "Capsule Nets" in an attempt to address
            some of these problems.  We will look at Hinton's complaints about CNNs and how
            "Capsule Nets" work to address these issues.  The CapsuleNet architecture is
            described in two main papers.
