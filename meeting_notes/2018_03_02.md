## Summary

- Short walk through of a toy regression problem from Coursera ML regression
  class
- Four of us will be doing the Coursera DL specialization.
- For our weekly meetings, we can do walk throughs of a Coursera submission to
  see if it seems likely to meet the criteria of an assumed rubric.
- Tested our video speed with WaveNet recording: https://youtu.be/hzpxXZJQNFg
- Discussion on Intel's Artic Sound recently announced device

- Mentions of meetups in the area that look interested to attend

- Write your own neural network.  This will probably be covered in the Coursera
  DL specialization as it was on Udacity (search for the project "Miniflow")
  If not, this book to be published in May 2018 provides decent coverage
  (available as a MEAP).

## Future

- Paul and Scott will collect some of the submissions from the DL and car nanos
